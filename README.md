===================


restores previous custom role when plugin is activated. This is an extension of an example found in chapter 8 from Professional WordPress Plugin Development.

This plugin allows users to be set for several forum roles. Once the plugin is deactivated, all those users are set as just subscribers.
If the plugin is reactivated, the users left as subscribers go back to their previous roles.

Every user who is in this scenario uses its meta data to save the forum role so they can go back to their roles.
